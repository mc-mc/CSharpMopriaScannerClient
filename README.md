This is a C#   Mopria Scanner Client proof of concept.   

I wrote this when my Windows PC was having trouble talking to my networked Xerox  multifunction printer / scanner.   
The printer part worked fine,  but the scanner device seemed to disappear everytime it was powered off and I had to re-install the drivers.

For this program, enter the scanner's IP address and then click the buttons to get the Status and  Capabilities.   Then initiate a scan and fetch the results. 

Very basic at the moment,  but it does work!
